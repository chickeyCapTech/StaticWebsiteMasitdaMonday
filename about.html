                <h1>About Caroline's Concerts</h1>
                <p>Caroline is a music lover who enjoys attending concerts and discovering new artists.</p>
                <p>Out of the five concerts Caroline has been to this year, her favorite was Fontaines D.C., an indie rock band from Dublin. She saw this at The Anthem in D.C. </p>
                <p>Her least favorite concert was George Clanton, an indie electroic artist. The music was okay, but the artist drank too much and kept talking about the Red Hot Chili Peppers.</p>
